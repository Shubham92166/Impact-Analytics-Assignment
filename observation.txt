For ques-1, We need to find the total no. of ways to attend classes over N days. So, on each day, we have two choices, either to attend
or not attend. Therefore, for N days, there will be 2^N ways.

For ques-2, 

To get the probability of missing the graduation ceremony, we need to get the total no. of ways to attend the classes over N days and
the total no. of ways to attend graduation ceremony without violating the rules.

We will get the total no. of ways to attend the classes over N days from ques-1.

So, the formula becomes,

No. of ways to miss the graduation ceremony = total no. of ways to attend the classes over N days - total no. of ways to attend the 
graduation ceremony without vioating rules.

As given in the question, if we miss the classes for 4 or more consecutive days then we will not be eligible to attend graduation 
ceremony. This means that we can miss the classes upto 3 consecutive days and still be eligible to attend the graduation ceremony. to
calculate this we can make a recurrence relation as

f(x) = sum of classes with miss days and classes without miss days. 
where f(x) denotes the total no. of ways to attend the graduation ceremony. 

This can be calculated using Knapsack approach. 

In order, to calculate the total no. of ways to attend the classes over N days, we can calculate 2^N, we will be implementing our custom
method to calculate power instead of using built in function.
